## What I Have Learned

Through the process of building this Battleship game project, I have acquired the following skills and knowledge:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Embraced the TDD methodology, writing tests with Jest to validate the functionality and reliability of the game components

- **Game Development**: Gained experience in developing a  game, including implementing game rules, player interaction, and visual feedback

- **JavaScript Mastery**: I've developed a strong understanding of JavaScript, particularly ES6 features, and applied this knowledge to create game logic and interactivity

- **ES6 Classes and Modules**: Utilized ES6 classes and modules to structure and organize code efficiently, promoting better code maintainability

- **Webpack and Babel**: Used Webpack to bundle and manage project's dependencies. Utilized Babel to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6) into a format compatible with older browsers, ensuring wider compatibility

- **Git and GitHub**: Practiced version control and collaboration by using Git and hosting the project on GitHub


By working on this project, I've expanded my skills as a developer and gained valuable experience in software development practices
